Here's a breakdown of the plan to reimplement the ls command with the specified options and functions:

1. Define Functions:

    print_file_info(struct stat *statbuf, char *path): This function takes a stat structure and a file path as input and formats the information according to the requested options (-l, -r, -t, etc.) using the provided data.
    print_dir_contents(char *path): This function takes a directory path as input and performs the following steps:
        Opens the directory using opendir.
        Reads directory entries using readdir in a loop.
            For each entry:
                Skips entries "." and ".." if the -a option is not specified.
                Obtains file status using stat or lstat depending on whether it's a symbolic link (use lstat for -l or symbolic links).
                Calls print_file_info to display file information based on options.
        Closes the directory using closedir.
    is_directory(char *path): This function checks if the given path points to a directory using stat.
    compare_mtime(struct stat *stat1, struct stat *stat2): This function compares the modification times of two files represented by the stat structures. It can be used for sorting with the -t option.
    get_username(uid_t uid): This function retrieves the username corresponding to a user ID using getpwuid.
    get_groupname(gid_t gid): This function retrieves the group name corresponding to a group ID using getgrgid.

2. Main Program:

    Parse command-line arguments using appropriate libraries (not covered in the specified functions).
    Validate and handle invalid options or arguments (e.g., incorrect combinations, non-existent paths).
    Iterate over the provided paths:
        If the path is a file:
            Use stat to get file information.
            Call print_file_info to display information.
        If the path is a directory and the -R (recursive) option is specified:
            Call print_dir_contents to list the directory contents.
            For each file/subdirectory within the directory:
                Construct the full path by appending the filename to the current path.
                Recursively call the main program with the constructed path to process subdirectories.

3. Handling Options:

    -l (long format): Use the stat information within print_file_info to display details like file type, permissions, owner, group, size, and timestamps.
    -r (reverse): Sort the output by modification time in descending order using compare_mtime within print_dir_contents.
    -t (sort by modification time): Sort the output by modification time in ascending order using compare_mtime within print_dir_contents.
    -u (sort by last access time): Use stat.st_atime within compare_mtime for sorting in print_dir_contents.
    -f (force): Even for executables without permission to list, try to print basic information using lstat (if -l is specified) or stat. Handle errors appropriately using perror and strerror.
    -g (show group): Use get_groupname within print_file_info to display the group name instead of the group ID.
    -d (directories only): In print_dir_contents, only process and display directory entries, skipping regular files.
    -G (color): While not directly supported by the given functions, you can explore using external libraries or terminal escape sequences to implement basic color-coding for different file types (e.g., red for directories, green for executable files).
    -1 (one entry per line): No need for special handling as this is the default behavior of print_dir_contents.

4. Additional Considerations:

    Handle symbolic links appropriately using lstat when the -l option is specified.
    Use readlink to read the contents of symbolic links if needed.
    Implement error handling using perror and strerror to provide informative messages for issues like file not found, permission denied, etc.
    Free any dynamically allocated memory using free to avoid memory


## ACL
Unfortunately, directly handling Access Control Lists (ACLs) is beyond the scope of the provided functions and might require additional libraries or system calls depending on the specific system and implementation. However, you can still provide a basic ls implementation that acknowledges the presence of ACLs and avoids misleading output.

Here's how you can adapt the plan to account for ACLs:

1. Define Functions:

    print_file_info(struct stat *statbuf, char *path):
        In addition to the existing functionalities, check if extended attributes are supported using faccess(path, F_GETEA) before calling listxattr.
        If extended attributes are supported and the -l option is specified, attempt to retrieve the ACL information using getxattr(path, "system.posix_acl.access").
        If ACL retrieval is successful, indicate the presence of ACLs in the output (e.g., by appending +ACL to the permissions string).
        Handle errors from faccess and getxattr gracefully using perror and strerror.

2. Main Program:

    No changes required.

3. Handling Options:

    -l (long format):
        Call the modified print_file_info to potentially indicate the presence of ACLs.

4. Additional Considerations:

    While you cannot directly parse or interpret ACLs using the provided functions, acknowledging their presence helps prevent users from misinterpreting standard permission outputs.
    Be aware that the specific method for retrieving and interpreting ACL information might vary depending on the system and file system implementation.

Note: This approach provides a basic indication of ACLs but doesn't offer full-fledged ACL management capabilities. If you require more advanced ACL handling, you'll need to explore system-specific libraries or tools designed for ACL manipulation.
