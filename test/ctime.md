There are two main differences between `ctime` and "normal time" (often referred to as "modification time" or "mtime") in the context of file systems:

**1. What they represent:**

- **ctime:** Refers to the **last time the file's metadata changed**. This includes changes in permissions, ownership, group, or other file system attributes, **not necessarily the content of the file itself**.
- **Normal time (mtime):** Refers to the **last time the actual contents of the file were modified**. This is the timestamp typically shown by default in `ls -l` output, without the `-c` option.

**2. How they are changed:**

- **ctime:** Gets updated **whenever any metadata of the file is modified**, even if the content remains unchanged. This can happen due to various actions, like changing permissions, ownership, or using specific file system commands that modify attributes.
- **Normal time (mtime):** Gets updated **only when the actual content of the file is modified**. This typically happens through writing new data, deleting existing data, or saving changes made within an editor or application.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature        | ctime                                              | Normal Time (mtime)                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Represents      | Last metadata change time                          | Last content modification time                                  |
| Updated by      | Any change to file metadata (permissions, owner, etc.) | Modification of the file's content                                   |
| Shown by default | `ls -lct` or explicitly using the `-c` option       | `ls -l` (without `-c`)                                            |

**Example:**

- You create a text file (`file.txt`). This sets both `ctime` and `mtime` to the same time.
- You change the permissions of `file.txt` using `chmod`. This updates `ctime` but **not** `mtime` as the content remains unchanged.
- You open `file.txt` in a text editor and modify its content. This updates **both** `ctime` and `mtime`.

In conclusion, understanding the distinction between `ctime` and normal time can be crucial when working with files and interpreting timestamps. Consider which time is relevant for your specific needs depending on whether you're interested in changes to the file's content or its metadata.
